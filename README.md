## :books: General info

* Extract from the [Ion-picker](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/picker) documentation: A Picker is a dialog that displays a row of buttons and columns underneath. It appears on top of the app's content, and at the bottom of the viewport.
* No extra imported dependencies; picker controller component is part of ionic/angular, picker options component is part of ionic/core. Note: picker buttons components was not used.
